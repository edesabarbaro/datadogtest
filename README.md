# Solutions Engineer Test

Disclaimer: before doing this test, I had never installed a VM, barely used a terminal and I wasn't familiar with command lines, coding or doing everything from a command prompt. I learned everything in order to pass this test, hence made a lot of mistakes that took some time to correct (and to understand). I will detail every step of my learning and the discoveries I made, as well as how I corrected the mistakes - a lot of googling has been involved and a lot of careful reading too.

First, I started by reading the [Github introduction guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and followed it to create my own repository [hello-world](https://github.com/edesabarbaro/hello-world) as I had never used Github before. I read about Markdown files to understand what they were and to better format the text for readability. I explored the [Datadog Github environment](https://github.com/DataDog) to see what projects looked like, then I read the whole exercice again and started it.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application!

## Prerequisites - Setup the environment

* I downloaded Vagrant and VirtualBox, then checked with the cmd on Windows with `vagrant -v` if Vagrant was properly installed:

* I tried to run the VM on the cmd but it did not work: I realised the terminal on Windows was not able to do that.

So, I downloaded Cmder and initialized the VM with 'vagrant init hashicorp/precise64'
